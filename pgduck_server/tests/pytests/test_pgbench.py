# with two gotchas. First, we included the
# queries in files instead of directly using -b option
# this is because when -b is used, pgbench executes some
# metadata queries, which fails on duckdb
# Second, we do not load any data, because loading data
# fails on duckdb for various reasons. However, that's not
# what we want to test here, we want to test the extended protocol
# so we don't care about query results
